# Project Structure

## Basic Project Layout
`gtml` expects a very specific project structure. It looks like this:
```bash
./myapp
./myapp/components
./myapp/routes
./myapp/dist
./myapp/static
```

These directories form the foundation of a `gtml` application and are required. Without these directories, `gtml` will fail to compile.
