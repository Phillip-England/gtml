You may find in a component a special type of script tag called a "gtml script". Gtml scripts are just regular javascript with a tiny bit of sugar syntax on top. This sugar gets boiled down into plain javascript at the end of the day.

They look like this:

```html
<script type='gtml'></script>
```
