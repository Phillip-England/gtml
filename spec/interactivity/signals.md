We are going to make use of javascript signals behind the scenes so we will need a very good signal class which will be used throughout the project to help make components interactive. The idea is that props can be converted into signals, allowing us to directly target them and make changes to them. However, our users will have convient syntax to allow them to access and change signals easily. gtml will do compilation work on the backend to convert their sugar syntax into actual signal class usage. It is important we have a solid signal class to work with.
