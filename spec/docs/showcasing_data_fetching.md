# Showcasing Data Fetching

## Making use os JSONPlaceholder
We should make use of the site, https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to get mock API data to test our fetch components.

## Fetching Showcase Sections
I should have multiple examples of how to fetch data client-side data using gtml so people know exactly how things operate. All of this should be in our documentation website. I should have a section which shows a basic fetch. I should have nested data examples. I should have examples which showcase the suspend and fallback elements as well. These sections should clearly outline how fetch works and how to use it in their projects.
