# Doucmentation Site Layout

## Home Page
The home page of the docs will outline what gtml is and have a call to action button which prompts people to jump right into the docs. It has a hero section where this call of action is located. Below the hero section is a simple hello world example of gtml with the git repo https://github.com/phillip-england/gtml so people know where to go checkout the code.

## Documentation Page
As of now, the documentation site will have a single documentation page that shows how the project works. It will have quick navigation to different sections and the page will be organized in a structured manner. The goal of the documentation is to showcase features while showing how to use them effectively.

## Documentation Page navigation
The documentation page is to have a sidebar which remains in view regardless of where in the page we are located scroll-wise. This is important so users can get around on the site easily. In this way, when we scroll on the navigation page, it should only move the content section (the section with the documentation). This allows us to provide a seamless UX when utilizing the docs.

## Documentation Styling
The documentation site will be styled with tailwind as the preinstalled components utilize tailwind for styling.
