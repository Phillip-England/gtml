# Doucmentation Site Layout

## Home Page
The home page of the docs will outline what gtml is and have a call to action button which prompts people to jump right into the docs. It has a hero section where this call of action is located. Below the hero section is a simple hello world exaple of gtml with the git repo https://github.com/phillip-england/gtml so people know where to go checkout the code.

## Documentation Page
As of now, the documentation site will have a single documentation page that shows how the project works. It will have quick naviagation to different sections and the page will be organized in a structured manner. The goal of the documentation is to showcase features while showing how to use them effectively.
