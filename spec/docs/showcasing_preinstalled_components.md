# Showcasing Preinstalled Components

## The Emphasis on Reusable Components
I should have a portion of the site which is dedicated to showcasing our preinstalled components which come with gtml out of the box. This gives users a chance to see what the components look like when in use.

## Sort Based On Type
The pages for showcasing preinstalled components should show one component per page and should show to gtml code for the component at the top of the page. This gives users a nice way to see each component and the code which generates them.
